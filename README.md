MASM x86
## Description:
This program is built using MASM x86, to be run within IA-32 architecture. This program prompts the user to enter a certain number of integers within a defined range. The program stores these integers, converts them to ASCII character strings and holds them in an array of BYTEs (i.e. a string) which is displayed back to the user. Some additional calculations are performed and displayed back to the user.
